ðŸ’° Roobing the Bank

This is a simple text-based console game written in Python where you play as a bank robber. You have 3 steps to make decisions: crack the safe, rob the cash register, or leave the bank before getting caught. But be careful â€” every action increases your risk of being caught by the police!

ðŸŽ® Game Rules

You have 3 steps before the police arrive.
You can choose to:
crack â€” Crack the safe (high reward, high risk).
robbed â€” Rob the cash register (lower reward, lower risk).
leave â€” Leave the bank (no money, but no risk).
If you're caught â€” you lose all your money and go to jail.
Your decisions affect the outcome of the game. Sometimes it's better to run while you still can!
ðŸ§  Game Logic Example

if choice == "crack":
    # Get a lot of money, but use up a step
elif choice == "robbed":
    # Get less money, but safer
elif choice == "leave":
    # Exit safely with no money
else:
    print("Invalid choice.")
ðŸ“¦ Modules Used

random â€” to generate random amounts of money and risk of being caught.
